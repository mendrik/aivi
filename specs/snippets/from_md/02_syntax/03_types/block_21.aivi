// Type-variable constraints for class members

// Simple case: constrain member type variables
class = Collection (C *) => with (A: Eq) {
  elem: A -> C A -> Bool
  unique: C A -> C A
}

// Combined: superclass composition + constrained member variables
class = Monad (M *) =>
  Applicative (M *) with (A: Eq, B: Show) {
    bind: M A -> (A -> M B) -> M B
  }

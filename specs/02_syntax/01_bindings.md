# Bindings and Scope

## 1.1 Definitions

All bindings use `=`:

* values
* functions
* types
* classes
* instances
* modules

```aivi
pi = 3.14159
add = x y => x + y
```


## 1.2 Shadowing

Bindings are lexical and may be shadowed.

```aivi
x = 1
x = x + 1
```

This introduces a new binding; no mutation exists. This is common in functional languages like OCaml and Rust (re-binding) but distinct from mutation.

## 1.2.1 Recursion (module level)

Within a module body (flat or braced), top-level value bindings are **recursive**: a binding may refer to itself and to bindings that appear later in the same module body.

This supports ordinary recursive functions:

```aivi
module demo.recursion
export sum

sum =
  | []        => 0
  | [h, ...t] => h + sum t
```

Local recursion inside `do { ... }` / `effect { ... }` blocks is a future surface feature; in v0.1, prefer defining recursive helpers at module scope.


## 1.3 Pattern Bindings

Structural patterns may appear in bindings.

```aivi
{ name } = user      // Shorthand for { name: name }
{ name: n } = user   // Rename binding to 'n'
[h, ...t] = xs       // List destructuring
```

* `=` may only be used where the compiler can prove the pattern is **total** (i.e., it covers all possible shapes of the data).
* Potentially failing matches (refutable patterns) must use `?` (case analysis) or appear in a context where failure can be handled.

> [!NOTE]
> Using `=` with a non-total pattern (like `[h, ...t] = []`) results in a compile-time error. For partial matches, use the `?` operator which converts a refutable pattern into an `Option` or branch.


## 1.4 Whole-value binding with `@`

Patterns may bind the **entire value** alongside destructuring.

```aivi
user@{ name: n } = input
user@{ name } = input
```

Semantics:

* `user` is bound to the whole value
* `{ name: n }` destructures the same value
* no duplication or copying occurs

Allowed in:

* Top-level and local bindings
* `?` pattern arms (allowing capture of the matched sub-structure)
* Function clauses 

Example:

```aivi
// u is bound to the full record; id/name come from destructuring
formatUser = u@{ id, name } => "{id}: {name}"
```


## 1.5 Usage Examples

### Config Binding

```aivi
config = {
  host: "localhost"
  port: 8080
  debug: True
}

{ host, port } = config
serverUrl = "http://{host}:{port}" 
```

### Tuple Destructuring

```aivi
point = (10, 20)
(x, y) = point

distance = sqrt ((x * x) + (y * y))
```

### Deep path destructuring

Record destructuring supports **dot-paths** to access nested fields directly. This combines path addressing with the `@` whole-value binder.

```aivi
{ data.user.profile@{ name } } = response
```

Semantics:
* `data.user.profile` is the path to the record being destructured.
* `@{ name }` binds the fields of that specific nested record.
* Intermediate records are **not** bound unless explicitly requested.

This is exactly equivalent to the nested expansion:
```aivi
{ data: { user: { profile: p@{ name } } } } = response
```
But much more readable for deep hierarchies.

> [!NOTE]
> Deep path destructuring is a powerful tool for working with complex JSON-like data, providing both brevity and clarity.

### List Head/Tail

```aivi
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[first, second, ...rest] = numbers

// first = 1, second = 2, rest = [3, 4, 5]
```

### Function Definitions

```aivi
// Named function
greet = name => "Hello, {name}!"

// Multi-argument
add = x y => x + y

// With type annotation
multiply : Int -> Int -> Int
multiply = a b => a * b
```

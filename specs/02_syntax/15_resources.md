# Resource Management

AIVI provides a dedicated `Resource` type to manage lifecycles (setup and teardown) in a declarative way. This ensures that resources like files, sockets, and database connections are always reliably released, even in the event of errors or task cancellation.


## 15.1 Defining Resources

Resources are defined using `resource` blocks. The syntax is analogous to generators: you perform setup, `yield` the resource, and then perform cleanup.

The code after `yield` is guaranteed to run when the resource goes out of scope.

```aivi
// Define a reusable resource
managedFile path = resource {
  handle <- file.open path  // Acquire
  yield handle              // Provide to user
  _ <- file.close handle    // Release
}
```

This declarative approach hides the complexity of error handling and cancellation checks.


## 15.2 Using Resources

Inside an `effect` block, you use the `<-` binder to acquire a resource. This is similar to the generator binder, but instead of iterating, it scopes the resource to the current block.

```aivi
main = effect {
  // Acquire resource
  f <- managedFile "data.txt"
  
  // Use resource
  content <- file.readAll f
  _ <- print content
  pure Unit
} // f is automatically closed here
```

### Multiple Resources

You can acquire multiple resources in sequence. They will be released in reverse order of acquisition (LIFO).

```aivi
copy src dest = effect {
  input  <- managedFile src
  output <- managedFile dest
  
  _ <- file.copyTo input output
  pure Unit
}
```

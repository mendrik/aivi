# Missing Features (v0.1 Gap Analysis)

This document lists features, modules, and behaviors described in the **AIVI Language Specification** vs. the **v0.1 Rust Implementation**.

> **Note to Users:** AIVI v0.1 is an interpreted language embedding a CST-to-Kernel pipeline. Native code generation (Rust/WASM) via `rust_codegen` is currently a harness for the interpreter, not a true transpiler.

## 1. Syntax & Language Features

| Feature | Spec Section | Implementation Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Generators** | `02_syntax/07_generators` | **Missing / Partial** | `Generator` type exists in `checker.rs`, but full `yield`/resumption semantics in runtime need verification. |
| **Decorators** | `02_syntax/14_decorators` | **Missing** | Not present in parser/cst. |
| **User-defined Domains** | `02_syntax/06_domains` | **Implemented** | `DomainDecl` exists in CST/HIR. |
| **Patching** | `02_syntax/05_patching` | **Implemented** | `Patch` alias exists; desugaring logic present. |

## 2. Type System

| Feature | Spec Section | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Higher-Kinded Types** | `02_syntax/03_types` | **Structurally Implemented** | `Kind` enum (Star/Arrow) and builtins (`List: *->*`, `Effect: *->*->*`) exist in `checker.rs`. Complex inference scenarios may vary. |
| **Row Polymorphism** | `02_syntax/03_types` | **Implemented** | Open records and row extension/restriction logic present in `checker.rs`. |
| **Effect Typing** | `02_syntax/09_effects` | **Implemented** | `Effect E A` is a first-class type; `attempt`/`pure`/`fail` are built-ins. |

## 3. Standard Library Status

| Module | Status | Backend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `aivi.regex` | **Implemented** | Backed by `runtime/builtins/regex.rs`. |
| `aivi.net.http` | **Implemented** | Backed by `runtime/url_http.rs`. |
| `aivi.net.server` | **Implemented** | Backed by `runtime/http.rs` (using `aivi_http_server`). |
| `aivi.db` | **Partial** | `database.rs` exists in stdlib/runtime, likely SQLite wrapper. |
| `aivi.math` | **Implemented** | Extensive `math.rs` in stdlib. |

## 4. Tooling & Execution

| Component | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Native Codegen** | **Emulated** | `aivi build` embeds the program + interpreter into a Rust binary. It does **not** generate standalone Rust logic yet. |
| **Package Manager** | **Missing** | `aivi.toml` reading exists (`pm.rs`), but full dependency resolution/publishing is minimal. |
| **LSP** | **Implemented** | `aivi_lsp` crate exists with diagnostics, formatting, and definition lookup. |

## Walkthrough: The v0.1 Reality

If you are using AIVI v0.1 today, you are using a **high-integrity interpreter**.

1.  **The Code is the Truth**: The `crates/aivi/src/` directory contains the definition of the language.
    *   `syntax.rs` / `cst.rs` define what you can write.
    *   `checker.rs` defines a surprisingly capable type system (HKTs, Classes, Rows).
    *   `runtime/` implements the "magical" effects and IO.

2.  **Performance**:
    *   Code is lowered to a Kernel IR and interpreted.
    *   It is fast enough for scripting, servers (via Tokio integration), and tooling.
    *   It is **not yet** generating optimized WASM for high-performance compute, though the type system allows expressing it.

3.  **The "Rust" Target**:
    *   When you run `aivi build`, you get a Rust binary.
    *   However, inside that binary is your HIR program as JSON, and the AIVI runtime.
    *   This provides a self-contained executable but not the performance benefits of native Rust compilation *yet*.

# File Domain

This domain handles **File System Operations** defined as Side Effects.

Your code lives in memory, but data lives on disk. This domain bridges the gap. It allows you to:
*   **Read/Write**: Load text from a config file or save user data.
*   **Check**: See if a file exists before trying to open it.
*   **Inspect**: Get metadata like "How big is this file?" or "When was it last modified?"

Direct file access is dangerous (what if the file is locked? missing? corrupted?). By wrapping these operations in `Effect (Result ...)` types, AIVI forces you to handle failure cases (like "File Not Found") explicitely, making your programs crash-proof against disk errors.

## Overview

```aivi
use aivi.std.system.file use { read_text, stat }

// Safe reading
let content = read_text "config.json"

// Metadata inspection
match stat "large_video.mp4" {
    | Ok info => print "File size: ${info.size} bytes"
    | Err _   => print "File not found"
}
```

## Types

```aivi
FileStats = {
  size: Int          // Size in bytes
  created: Int       // Unix timestamp (ms)
  modified: Int      // Unix timestamp (ms)
  is_file: Bool
  is_directory: Bool
}
```

## Resource Operations

For more control or large files, use the resource-based API.

### `open`

```aivi
open : String -> Effect (Resource Handle)
```

Opens a file for reading. Returns a `Handle` resource that must be managed (e.g., with `resource` block).

### `readAll`

```aivi
readAll : Handle -> Effect (Result String Error)
```

Reads the entire content of an open file handle.

### `close`

```aivi
close : Handle -> Effect Unit
```

Closes the file handle. (Automatically called if using `resource` block).

## Path Operations

### `read_text`

```aivi
read_text : String -> Effect (Result String Error)
```

Reads the entire content of a file as a string.

### `write_text`

```aivi
write_text : String -> String -> Effect (Result Unit Error)
```

Writes a string to a file, overwriting it if it exists.

### `exists`

```aivi
exists : String -> Effect Bool
```

Checks if a file or directory exists at the given path.

### `stat`

```aivi
stat : String -> Effect (Result FileStats Error)
```

Retrieves metadata about a file or directory. Fails if path does not exist.

### `delete`

```aivi
delete : String -> Effect (Result Unit Error)
```

Deletes a file.

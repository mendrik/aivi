# HTTP Domain

The `Http` domain connects your program to the world. Whether you're fetching data from an API, submitting a form, or scraping a website, this domain provides the standard tools (`get`, `post`, `fetch`) to speak the language of the web reliably.

```aivi
use std.Http
```

## Functions

### `get`

get : Url -> Effect (Result Response Error)
```

### `post`

```aivi
post : Url -> String -> Effect (Result Response Error)
```

Performs a POST request with the given body.

### `fetch`

```aivi
fetch : Request -> Effect (Result Response Error)
```

## Types

### `Response`

```aivi
type Response = {
    status: Int,
    headers: Map String String,
    body: String
}
```

### `Request`

```aivi
type Request = {
    method: String,
    url: Url,
    headers: Map String String,

# Testing Domain

The `Testing` domain is built right into the language because reliability shouldn't be an afterthought. Instead of hunting for third-party runners or configuring complex suites, you can just write `@test` next to your code. It provides a standard, unified way to define, discover, and run tests, making sure your code does exactly what you think it does (and keeps doing it after you refactor).

## Overview

## Goals

Status:

- 🟢 Done
- 🟡 Partial
- 🔴 Missing

- 🟡 `test` keyword or block construct.
- 🟡 Assertions with rich diffs (`assertEq`, etc.).
- 🔴 Test discovery and execution via `aivi test`.
- 🔴 Property-based testing basics (generators) integration.

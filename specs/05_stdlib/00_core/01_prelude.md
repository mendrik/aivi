# Standard Library: Prelude

<!-- quick-info: {"kind":"module","name":"aivi.prelude"} -->
The **Prelude** is your default toolkit. It acts as the "standard library of the standard library," automatically using the core types and domains you use in almost every program (like `Int`, `List`, `Text`, and `Result`). It ensures you don't have to write fifty `use` lines just to add two numbers or print "Hello World".

## Opting Out

<<< ../../snippets/from_md/05_stdlib/00_core/01_prelude/block_02.aivi{aivi}

## Rationale

- Common domains (dates, colors, vectors) are used universally
- Delta literals should "just work" without explicit `use`
- Explicit opt-out preserves control for advanced use cases

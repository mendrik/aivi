# Roadmap

This section connects the implementation battle plan in the repo’s `roadmap/` folder to the published docs navigation.

Pages:
- [Overall Phases](01_overall_phases)
- [Rust Workspace Layout](02_rust_workspace_layout)
- [Language Implementation Plan](03_language_implementation)
- [Compiling to WASM/WASI](04_compiler_wasm_wasi)
- [Language Server (LSP)](05_language_server_lsp)
- [M8 LSP Track (Detailed)](m8_lsp/00_overview)
- [MCP Integration](06_mcp_integration)
- [M9 MCP Track (Detailed)](m9_mcp/00_overview)
- [Standard Library Plan](07_standard_library_plan)

Note: these pages mirror the canonical files in `roadmap/` so they render in the VitePress site.

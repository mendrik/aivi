# M8 LSP — Workplan

## Milestones

### L1: diagnostics + symbols

- Wire `didOpen`/`didChange` to parse.
- Publish syntax diagnostics.
- Provide document symbols for module exports and top-level bindings.

### L2: navigation + completion

- Resolve definitions across modules.
- Provide basic completions (keywords, in-scope names, exports).

### L3: types in UX

- Hover for inferred types and docs.
- Signature help for calls and pipes.

### L4: references + rename

- Workspace-wide references.
- Rename with export updates and conflict checks.

### L5: formatting + code actions

- CST formatting with stable output.
- Quick fixes for imports, type annotations, match cases.

### L6: semantic tokens + quality

- Tokens for value/type/module/constructor IDs.
- Optional inlay hints (types, effects).

## Dependencies

- Stable `Span`/`Range` mapping and `SourceMap`.
- Resolver and typechecker resilience on partial code.
- Formatter correctness on the current CST.

## Risks

- Latency regressions with larger workspaces.
- Incomplete module graph when files are missing/unsaved.
- Rename/refactor requires canonical symbol IDs and safe edits.

## Success metrics

- <200ms diagnostics for small files.
- No crashes on malformed or incomplete input.
- Users can navigate and rename across `specs/` and `examples/`.
